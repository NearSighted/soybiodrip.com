          "<b>Farm Community Gets Creative to Survive<br>
          Bruning, Neb., saves itself by making environmentally friendly oil</b>" 
          <br>
          The soybean oil addresses a particularly vexing environmental problem. 
          With an estimated three million gallons of petroleum-based oil now used 
          each year to lubricate irrigation-well shafts in arid states such as 
          Nebraska, Texas and California, environmentalists have long expressed 
          concern over the oil seeping into the groundwater supply, causing untold 
          contamination.<br>
          <br>
          Since soybean oil is derived from an edible plant, scientists view it 
          as a far safer replacement. Legislation is being considered in Nebraska 
          which would outlaw the use of petroleum oil in irrigation lubrication, 
          while the U.S. department of Agriculture has launched a pilot study 
          to see if federal government vehicles can be switched to alternative 
          fuels based on soybeans as well as seed oils or animal fat.<br>

          "<b>Soy Bio Drip Oil is Kind to Environment</b>" <br>
          Through a California irrigation season 71,000-plus turbine lineshafts 
          are each lubricated by 7 to 10 gallons of petroleum-based oil. This 
          oil entering at the top of the pump adds up to 497,000 to 710,000 gallons 
          of nonrecoverable petroleum-based oil per season. After 10 years of 
          irrigating, 4,970,000 to 7,100,000 gallons of petroleum-based oil enter 
          the wells.<br>
          <br>
          Growing environmental awareness and predictions by industry experts 
          regarding change in regulations pertaining to ground water have spurred 
          interest in vegetable oil-based lubricants. Vegetable oils are plentiful 
          in supply, offer excellent lubricating properties, and have an inherently 
          high-viscosity index.<br>
          <br>
          Mechanically expelled soy oil does not require solvent or chemicals 
          in the processing; no waste stream is generated. Soy Bio-Drip is an 
          expelled soy oil lubricate that has performed as well as, if not better 
          than, petroleum based and hexane-extracted oils in university tests. 
          As an added benefit, natural antioxidants prevent Soy Bio-Drip from 
          going rancid, a concern for microbial growth. <br>
          <br>
          Using Soy Bio-Drip Oil, a readily biodegradable, all-natural, nontoxic 
          lubricant is one way to address environmental concern.<br>

          "<b>Bio-Oil Offers Advantages</b>" <br>
          California farmers may not care much about promoting uses for soybean-based 
          products, but they operate irrigation pumps and are concerned about 
          protecting groundwater. Bingo! Consider the advantages of Soy Bio-Drip 
          irrigation oil. </font></li>
